# Reference Vocabulary

## 10. REFERENCE VOCABULARY (Pattern Names the Agent Should Know)

This is a vocabulary, not a library. The agent should KNOW these pattern names to communicate about them, design with them in mind, and reach for them when the design read calls for them. **Implementations and code sketches live in the Block Library (`blocks.md`), which is populated iteratively.**

### Hero Paradigms
* **Asymmetric Split Hero**: Text on one side, asset on the other, generous white space.
* **Editorial Manifesto Hero**: Large type, no asset, almost-poster.
* **Video / Media Mask Hero**: Type cut out as mask over video background.
* **Kinetic-Type Hero**: Animated typography as the primary visual.
* **Curtain-Reveal Hero**: Hero parts on scroll like a curtain.
* **Scroll-Pinned Hero**: Hero stays pinned while content scrolls behind.

### Navigation & Menus
* **Mac OS Dock Magnification**: Edge nav, icons scale fluidly on hover.
* **Magnetic Button**: Pulls toward cursor.
* **Gooey Menu**: Sub-items detach like viscous liquid.
* **Dynamic Island**: Morphing pill for status / alerts.
* **Contextual Radial Menu**: Circular menu expanding at click point.
* **Floating Speed Dial**: FAB springing into curved secondary actions.
* **Mega Menu Reveal**: Full-screen dropdown, stagger-fade content.

### Layout & Grids
* **Bento Grid**: Asymmetric tile grouping (Apple Control Center).
* **Masonry Layout**: Staggered grid, no fixed row height.
* **Chroma Grid**: Borders / tiles with subtle animating gradients.
* **Split-Screen Scroll**: Two halves sliding in opposite directions.
* **Sticky-Stack Sections**: Sections that pin and stack on scroll.

### Cards & Containers
* **Parallax Tilt Card**: 3D tilt tracking mouse coordinates.
* **Spotlight Border Card**: Borders illuminate under cursor.
* **Glassmorphism Panel**: Frosted glass with inner refraction.
* **Holographic Foil Card**: Iridescent rainbow shift on hover.
* **Tinder Swipe Stack**: Physical card stack, swipe-away.
* **Morphing Modal**: Button expands into its own dialog.

### Scroll Animations
* **Sticky Scroll Stack**: Cards stick and physically stack.
* **Horizontal Scroll Hijack**: Vertical scroll → horizontal pan.
* **Locomotive / Sequence Scroll**: Video / 3D sequence tied to scrollbar.
* **Zoom Parallax**: Central background image zooming on scroll.
* **Scroll Progress Path**: SVG line drawing along scroll.
* **Liquid Swipe Transition**: Page transition like viscous liquid.

### Galleries & Media
* **Dome Gallery**: 3D panoramic gallery.
* **Coverflow Carousel**: 3D carousel with angled edges.
* **Drag-to-Pan Grid**: Boundless draggable canvas.
* **Accordion Image Slider**: Narrow strips expanding on hover.
* **Hover Image Trail**: Mouse leaves popping image trail.
* **Glitch Effect Image**: RGB-channel shift on hover.

### Typography & Text
* **Kinetic Marquee**: Endless text bands reversing on scroll.
* **Text Mask Reveal**: Massive type as transparent window to video.
* **Text Scramble Effect**: Matrix-style decoding on load / hover.
* **Circular Text Path**: Text curving along spinning circle.
* **Gradient Stroke Animation**: Outlined text with running gradient.
* **Kinetic Typography Grid**: Letters dodging the cursor.

### Micro-Interactions & Effects
* **Particle Explosion Button**: CTA shatters into particles on success.
* **Liquid Pull-to-Refresh**: Reload indicator like detaching droplets.
* **Skeleton Shimmer**: Shifting light reflection across placeholders.
* **Directional Hover-Aware Button**: Fill enters from cursor's exact side.
* **Ripple Click Effect**: Wave from click coordinates.
* **Animated SVG Line Drawing**: Vectors drawing themselves in real time.
* **Mesh Gradient Background**: Organic lava-lamp blobs.
* **Lens Blur Depth**: Background UI blurred to focus foreground action.

### Animation Library Choice
* **Motion (`motion/react`)**: default for UI / Bento / state-change motion.
* **GSAP + ScrollTrigger**: for full-page scrolltelling and scroll hijacks. Isolate in dedicated leaf components with `useEffect` cleanup.
* **Three.js / WebGL**: for canvas backgrounds and 3D scenes. Same isolation rule.
* **NEVER mix GSAP / Three.js with Motion in the same component tree.** They fight over the same frames.
