# The Block Library

## 12. THE BLOCK LIBRARY (Contract: Implementations Land Here Iteratively)

The Reference Vocabulary (`vocabulary.md`) names patterns. The Block Library implements them with real props, real motion specs, and real code sketches.

**Status:** schema defined here. Blocks will be added iteratively. Do not freelance new blocks without following this schema.

### 12.A File Location
```
skills/taste-skill/blocks/
  hero/
    asymmetric-split.md
    editorial-manifesto.md
    kinetic-type.md
    ...
  feature/
    bento-grid.md
    sticky-scroll-stack.md
    zig-zag.md
    ...
  social-proof/
  pricing/
  cta/
  footer/
  navigation/
  portfolio/
  transition/
```

### 12.B Required Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: asymmetric-split-hero
category: hero
dial_compatibility:
  variance: [6, 10]
  motion: [3, 10]
  density: [2, 5]
when_to_use: "Landing pages with one strong asset and one strong message. Default hero for SaaS, agency, premium consumer."
not_for: "Editorial / manifesto launches where the message IS the design."
stack: ["react", "next", "tailwind", "motion"]
---
```

### 12.C Required Body Sections
1. **Visual sketch**: short ASCII or description of the layout.
2. **Props API**: the component's interface.
3. **Code sketch**: minimal working implementation (Server Component default, Client island for motion).
4. **Mobile fallback**: explicit collapse rules for `< 768px`.
5. **Motion variants**: one variant per `MOTION_INTENSITY` band (1-3, 4-7, 8-10). Reduced-motion fallback explicit.
6. **Dark-mode notes**: token strategy specific to this block.
7. **Anti-patterns**: common ways this block goes wrong.
8. **References**: links to real examples in production.

### 12.D Block-Library Discipline
* One block per file. No multi-block files.
* Every block must work standalone (drop it into a page, it renders).
* Every block must pass the Pre-Flight Check (`preflight.md`).
* Blocks that depend on a design system from `design-systems.md` 2.A live under `blocks/<category>/<name>--<system>.md` (e.g. `feature/bento-grid--material.md`).
